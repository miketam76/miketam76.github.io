  Hi, I’m <strong>Moon (Mike) Tam</strong>. My transition into software development is driven by a career-long 
  obsession with how systems work. My foundation was built over several years as an <strong>IT Support Technician</strong>, 
  where I developed a "troubleshooting-first" mindset. I later scaled this experience during a 2023–2024 student term with 
  the <strong>Canada Revenue Agency (CRA)</strong>, working within complex, enterprise-level environments.

<p>
  Currently, I am further honing my full-stack capabilities through the <strong>Web Development & Internet Applications</strong> 
  program at <strong>Algonquin College</strong>. This portfolio is a live record of that progress—showcasing everything from deep-logic 
  Java projects to modern, accessible Angular applications.

  When I’m not at my desk, I’m usually on my bike exploring the <strong>Ottawa Greenbelt</strong>. The quiet focus of those forest trails 
  inspired the theme of this site and provides the mental clarity I need for complex coding. My goal is to leverage this blend of technical 
  intuition and modern engineering to become a <strong>Senior Technical Consultant</strong>, bridging the gap between sophisticated technology 
  and the people who use it.
