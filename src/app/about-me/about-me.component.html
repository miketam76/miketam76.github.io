  Hi, I’m Moon (Mike) Tam. My journey into software development is built on a solid foundation of years spent as an <strong>IT Support Technician</strong>, where I mastered the art of technical troubleshooting and user-focused problem-solving. I recently expanded that expertise during a <strong>2023 - 2024 student term with the Canadian federal government</strong>, working within large-scale enterprise environments.

  I like to code whenever I can squeeze it in between family life, work, and school, and this blog is where I share the projects I’ve built along the way. When I’m not coding, you’ll probably find me biking along the <strong>greenbelt paths</strong>. These quiet trails inspired this blog’s forest theme and help me clear my head. My goal is to continue growing as a software developer, eventually stepping into a <strong>Senior Technical Consultant</strong> role where I can bridge the gap between complex technology and real-world user needs.
