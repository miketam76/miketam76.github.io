  <p>
    Hi, I’m <strong>Moon (Mike) Tam</strong>. My transition into software development is driven by a career-long 
    obsession with how systems work. My foundation was built over several years as an <strong>IT Support Technician</strong>, 
    where I developed a "troubleshooting-first" mindset. I later scaled this experience during a 2023–2024 student term with 
    the <strong>Canada Revenue Agency (CRA)</strong>, working within complex, enterprise-level environments.
  </p>

  <p>
    Currently, I am further honing my full-stack capabilities through the <strong>Web Development & Internet Applications</strong> 
    program at <strong>Algonquin College</strong>. This portfolio is a live record of that progress—showcasing everything from deep-logic 
    Java projects to modern, accessible Angular applications.
  </p>

  <p>
    When I’m not at my desk, I’m usually on my bike exploring the <strong>Ottawa Greenbelt</strong>. The quiet focus of those forest trails 
    inspired the theme of this site and provides the mental clarity I need for complex coding. My goal is to leverage this blend of technical 
    intuition and modern engineering to become a <strong>Senior Technical Consultant</strong>, bridging the gap between sophisticated technology 
    and the people who use it.
