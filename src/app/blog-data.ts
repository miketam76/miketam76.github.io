            <h4>The Final Deployment</h4>
            
            <p>Today is a major milestone. After a year of specialization and late-night coding sessions, I am officially launching this portfolio and blog.</p>

            <p>
                Building this site was a challenge in technical execution. What began as a plan to showcase my developer transition has evolved into a fully responsive <strong>Angular</strong> application. This month, I focused on the final details: completing the <strong>FitForge</strong> design system in Figma and integrating the "Forest Journey" theme across the entire UI. 
            </p>

            <p>
                This site serves as a live demonstration of my <strong>front-end foundation</strong>. Every decision, from the <strong>AODA-compliant</strong> footer to the symmetry of the headers, was made to meet the standards required in a professional enterprise environment. It represents the first major step in my trajectory toward becoming a <strong>Full-Stack Developer</strong>.
            </p>

            <p>
                As 2026 approaches, my goal is simple: to secure a <strong>Junior Analyst/Developer</strong> role where I can apply this mix of technical intuition and modern software engineering. 
            </p>

            <h4>Seeking Depth in Web Development</h4>
            
            <p>This month marks a pivot in my career. I’ve officially returned to <strong>Algonquin College</strong> for the <strong>Web Development & Internet Applications</strong> program.</p>

            <p>
                My first diploma was a great foundation, but the core building blocks—<strong>HTML, CSS, and JavaScript</strong>—were squeezed into a single course. To reach the <strong>Senior Consultant</strong> level I'm aiming for, I need a much deeper mastery of those technologies. 
            </p>

            <p>
                This program offers that specialized focus. I’m currently diving into advanced front-end architecture while building a backend foundation with <strong>C#, ASP.NET Core, and MVC</strong>.
            </p>

            <p>
                I am also exploring <strong>Figma prototyping</strong> to bridge the gap between design and code. My goal is to combine these backend capabilities with my front-end skills to build software that is both scalable and user-focused.
            </p>
            
            <p>The journey continues!</p>

            <h4>A Self-Taught Milestone</h4>
            
            <p>
                Before starting formal classes at Algonquin, I challenged myself to build a functional <strong>Enigma Encryption Engine</strong> in Java. This project was a deep dive into pure <strong>algorithmic logic</strong> and state management.
            </p>

            <p>
                The challenge was recreating the complex physical signal path of the machine. I architected the code to process each letter through nine distinct stages: 
                <strong>Plugboard → Rotor 1 → Rotor 2 → Rotor 3 → Reflector → Rotor 3 → Rotor 2 → Rotor 1 → Plugboard</strong>.
            </p>

            <p>
                In the final updates, I resolved a persistent bug in the <strong>plug cable configuration tracking</strong>, ensuring the system could accurately backtrack through ciphers. I also migrated the tool from a console-based interface to a <strong>Java Swing GUI</strong> for a better user experience.
            </p>

            <p>
                This project remains a favorite because it proves that a <strong>methodical, analytical approach</strong> can solve deep architectural puzzles even before formal training begins.
            </p>

            <p>
                For those interested in how the mechanics actually work, I referenced

            <h4>Welcome to my first blog post!</h4>
            
            <p>This space is the culmination of a journey that began long before I started my degree at <strong>Algonquin College</strong>.</p>

            <p>
                For years, I worked as an <strong>IT Support Technician</strong>, solving hardware and software puzzles. That troubleshooting foundation led me into development, specifically during my 2023–2024 student term at the <strong>Canada Revenue Agency (CRA)</strong>, where I worked within complex, enterprise-level environments.
            </p>

            <p>
                While my core programming logic was built using <strong>Java and Python</strong>, I built this portfolio using <strong>Angular and TypeScript</strong>. These are skills I have spent the last few months self-teaching to ensure I am ready for the demands of modern web standards. This blog is where I’ll share the projects I’ve built—ranging from deep-logic Java applications to the responsive Angular project you see here.
            </p>

            <p>
                I chose a forest theme because nature is my primary inspiration. Biking the <strong>Greenbelt paths</strong> here in Ottawa helps me clear my mind for complex coding. I also take walks through <strong>Hogs Back Park</strong> and <strong>Mooney's Bay</strong> to reflect on my progress.
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Whether you’re a fellow developer or a former colleague, I hope this space offers a useful perspective on technical growth and professional evolution as I transition from fixing systems to architecting them.
            </p>

            <p>Thanks for stopping by!</p>
