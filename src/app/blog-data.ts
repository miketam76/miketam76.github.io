            <h4>A Christmas Eve Launch</h4>
            
            <p>Today is a major milestone. After a year of intense specialization and coding, I am officially launching my professional portfolio and blog.</p>

            <p>
                Building this site was a journey of technical evolution. What started as a goal to showcase my <strong>CRA student term</strong> has evolved into a fully responsive <strong>Angular</strong> application. It reflects the technical skills I've gained through <strong>Algonquin College</strong> and <strong>Udemy</strong>, alongside my identity as a developer in the <strong>Ottawa tech community</strong>.
            </p>

            <p>
                This month was focused on final execution. I successfully wrapped up my <strong>FitForge</strong> design system project in Figma and integrated the "Forest Journey" theme across this entire site. Every centered header and <strong>AODA-compliant</strong> detail was a deliberate choice to ensure this site meets enterprise standards.
            </p>

            <p>
                As I look toward 2026, my focus is clear: continuing my deep dive into <strong>Full Stack development</strong> and securing a <strong>Junior Analyst/Developer</strong> role where I can apply my <strong>technical intuition</strong> and modern software engineering skills.

            <h4>Seeking Depth in Web Development</h4>
            
            <p>This month marks a significant pivot in my career. I have officially returned to <strong>Algonquin College</strong> for the <strong>Web Development & Internet Applications</strong> program.</p>

            <p>
                During my initial Computer Programming studies, the essential building blocks of the web — <strong>HTML, CSS, and JavaScript</strong> — were covered as a baseline. However, I realized that to reach the <strong>Senior Technical Consultant</strong> level I am aiming for, I need a much deeper mastery of these core technologies.
            </p>

            <p>
                This new program offers the specialized focus I’ve been looking for. I’m diving deep into advanced front-end architecture and robust <strong>Backend development</strong> using <strong>C#, ASP.NET Core, and MVC</strong>.
            </p>

            <p>
                I am also exploring <strong>Graphic Design and Figma prototyping</strong> to ensure my applications are as user-friendly as they are technically sound. I am excited to combine my <strong>enterprise systems foundation</strong> with these modern full-stack capabilities to build scalable, professional-grade software.
            </p>
            
            <p>The journey continues, and the forest is getting a little deeper!</p>

        title: 'Logic in Layers: The Enigma Engine',
        date: 'January 3, 2025',

            <h4>A Self-Taught Milestone</h4>
            
            <p>
                Before enrolling in the Computer Programming program at <strong>Algonquin College</strong>, I challenged myself to build a functional <strong>Enigma Encryption Engine</strong> in Java. This project was a deep dive into pure <strong>algorithmic logic</strong> and state management.
            </p>

            <p>
                The core challenge was recreating the complex signal path of the historical machine. I architected the code to process each letter through nine distinct stages: 
                <strong>Plugboard → Rotor 1 → Rotor 2 → Rotor 3 → Reflector → Rotor 3 → Rotor 2 → Rotor 1 → Plugboard</strong>.
            </p>

            <p>
                In the final updates, I successfully resolved a persistent bug regarding <strong>plug cable configuration tracking</strong>. The system now perfectly manages signal backtracking to accurately decode ciphers. Alongside this logic fix, I migrated the project from a console tool to a <strong>Java Swing GUI</strong>, providing a visual interface for the rotors and plugboard settings.
            </p>

            <p>
                Managing the state of a character as it transforms across these stages required rigorous logic and modulo arithmetic. This project remains a favorite because it proves that a <strong>methodical, analytical approach</strong> can solve deep architectural puzzles even before formal training begins.
            </p>

            <p>
                If you are interested in the mechanics of the machine, I highly recommend this video by

                which was instrumental in helping me visualize the internal functionality.

            <h4>Welcome to my first blog post!</h4>
            
            <p>This space is the culmination of a journey that began long before I started my Computer Programming degree at Algonquin College.</p>

            <p>
                For years, I worked in the trenches of <strong>IT Support</strong>, solving complex hardware and software puzzles. That troubleshooting foundation eventually led me to the world of development, where I recently applied my skills during a 2024 student term with the <strong>Canada Revenue Agency (CRA)</strong>.
            </p>

            <p>
                I built this portfolio using <strong>Angular and TypeScript</strong> — skills I mastered through intensive self-study to ensure I was ready for the demands of the modern web. This blog is my way of sharing the projects I’ve built and the technical challenges I tackle as I move from troubleshooting systems to architecting them.
            </p>

            <p>
                I chose a forest theme because nature is my primary source of inspiration. Biking along the <strong>greenbelt paths</strong> here in Ottawa helps me clear my mind and sparks the creativity I need for complex coding projects. I also take long walks through <strong>Hogs Back Park</strong> and <strong>Mooney's Bay</strong> to reflect on my progress.
            </p>
            
            <p>
                Whether you are a fellow developer or a former colleague, I hope this space offers a useful perspective on balancing technical growth with <strong>family life</strong> and professional evolution.
            </p>

            <p>Thank you for stopping by — I’m excited to share this journey with you!</p>
